Introduction
============

`django-drf-filepond <https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/django-drf-filepond>`_ 
is a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ app providing a back-end 
implementation for `pqina <https://github.com/pqina/>`_'s excellent 
`filepond <https://pqina.nl/filepond/>`_ file upload library. This initial 
version of the app includes support for filepond's ``process``, ``revert``, 
``fetch``, ``restore`` and ``load`` endpoints allowing the core file upload 
functions of the library to be used.
