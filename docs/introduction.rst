Introduction
============

django-drf-filepond is a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ app providing a back-end implementation for 
pqina's excellent filepond file upload library. This initial version of the 
app includes support for filepond's process, revert and fetch endpoints 
allowing the core file upload functions of the library to be used.

Support for the ``restore`` and ``load`` endpoints will be added in the next 
version of the app.
